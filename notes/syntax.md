#### Function declaration:

```clojure
(defn my_function[])
```

``defn`` is used for creating a function, the parameters are stored in ``[]``. Instead of using curly braces after the 
function is made and when it ends, the entire function is wrapped in parentheses.

#### Function calling:

```clojure
(my_function)
```

To call a function, put the name of the function in parentheses, if the function takes arguments it doesn't need a comma
to separate them:

```clojure
(my_function "string argument" 1)
```

#### Symbols

You don't need a semicolon at the end of the line
